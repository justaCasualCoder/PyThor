# PyThor
Thor Flash Utility, in Python.

PyThor is a flash utility for Samsung devices, made in Python. It was inspired by the amazing [Thor Flash Utility](https://github.com/Samsung-Loki/Thor).
It uses [pyusb](https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb/) for accessing Samsung devices. It's in beta, so it may have a few issues.
